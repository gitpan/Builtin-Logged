NAME
    Builtin::Logged - Replace builtin functions with ones that log using
    Log::Any

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     use Builtin::Logged qw(system my_qx);

     system "blah ...";
     my $out = my_qx(blah ...);

    When run, it might produce logs like:

     [TRACE] system(): blah ...
     [TRACE] system() child error: 256 (exited with value 1)
     [TRACE] my_qx(): blah ...
     [TRACE] my_qx() child error: 0 (exited with value 0)

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides replacement for some builtin functions (and
    operators). The replacement behaves exactly the same, except that they
    are peppered with log statements from Log::Any. The log statements are
    at "trace" level.

    This module is useful if you already use Log::Any for your application.

EXPORTS
    *   system

    *   my_qx

        Will provide my_qx(). Use this instead of qx() or backtick. Perl
        currently does not provide an easy way to override/overload qx().
